## Description
**toppotty** allows users to search for and view local restrooms and their cleanliness ratings. Users can search for restrooms near their location, which they can view on a map.

Restroom locations and cleanliness ratings are submitted by users.  Users may add new restrooms, or add a rating to an existing restroom.

## Usage
Navigate to [http://toppotty.herokuapp.com/](http://toppotty.herokuapp.com/) to use the application

Home Page:
![homepage](https://raw.github.com/MBSchneider/top_potty/master/app/assets/images/toppottyScreenShot.png)

Finding a restroom:
From the homepage, input your location in the search bar and select male or female.  When the search is submitted, restrooms located in the vicinity will be displayed, sorted by distance from the search location.

Adding a rating:
After submitting a search, you may add your rating of a restroom's cleanliness by clicking on the appropriate button.  This will require you to log in to submit.

Adding a restroom:
You may add a new restroom by clicking on the link in the upper-right corner.  To add a new restroom, you must first confirm that the new restroom location does not already exist by searching for closeby restrooms.  Once you have confirmed it does not exist, you may submit the new restroom.  This will require you to log in.
